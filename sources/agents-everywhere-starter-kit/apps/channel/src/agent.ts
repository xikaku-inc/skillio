 * Channel-only facade that keeps AG-UI transcript/state on the outer agent while
 * delegating each low-level run to a fresh BuiltInAgent instance.
 *
 * Channels may re-enter the same turn after tool results as soon as the previous
 * observable completes. BuiltInAgent clears its private abort controller later,
 * in its async cleanup, so reusing one instance can trip its reentry guard. This
 * facade leaves AbstractAgent.runAgent untouched and swaps only run(input), which
 * gives every invocation a clean inner agent without changing the shared web and
 * mobile makeAgent factory.
