/**
 * Generative UI, controlled tier.
 *
 * `useComponent` gives the agent a catalog of *your* React components and lets
 * it choose one and fill in the props. The interface stays on-brand and
 * pixel-perfect because you wrote it — the agent only decides what to show.
 *
 * These are deliberately the same two components the Slack surface registers
 * with `defineChannelComponent`. Same agent, same intent, native rendering on
 * each surface — which is the whole claim this kit is making.
 *
 * Renderers receive streamed partial arguments before schema defaults apply.
