/**
 * The agent factory.
 *
 * Return a FRESH agent per threadId — never share one stateful instance across
 * conversations. Channels clones the agent per turn anyway, but a factory is the
 * documented shape and keeps per-thread state honest.
 *
 * To swap in LangGraph, CrewAI, Mastra, Pydantic AI, or Google ADK, replace the
 * body with an HttpAgent pointed at your agent's AG-UI endpoint:
 *
 *   import { HttpAgent } from "@ag-ui/client";
 *   return new HttpAgent({ url: process.env.AGENT_URL! });
 *
 * Nothing else in the kit changes. That is the point of AG-UI.
